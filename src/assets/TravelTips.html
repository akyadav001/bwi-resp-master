                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Research your destination:</span> Get copies of maps of your destination to locate routes, attractions, and essential services. Your library, travel agent, and the Internet are some good places to get information.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Talk to fellow travelers:</span> If you know people who have been to the place you plan to visit, ask them about what they liked about their trip and what they would do differently next time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Make a list and check it twice:</span> Make a list of essentials that you need to pack. Also, make a list of things you want to see and do on your trip.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Are you covered:</span> If you are traveling outside of the U.S., your health and accident insurance may not cover you. Also, look into travel insurance for cancellations or other travel mishaps.

                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Take advantage of those "hidden" spaces:</span>. For example, place small items inside your shoes or the pockets of shirts or jackets you pack.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Pack extra bags in your bag:</span> Packing a duffle bag in your luggage gives you extra space to bring things home with you. It's also a good idea to bring plastic sandwich or grocery bags for laundry or other items.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Tag those bags:</span> Tag your luggage with a distinctive luggage tag with your contact information to help you find your bag if you lose it. A distinctive tag makes it easier to spot your bag at baggage claim.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Don't pack what you can get at your destination:</span> Our hotels have a hair dryer in every room, along with many toiletry items, so you don't need to pack them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Avoid checking baggage if you can:</span> Limiting your baggage to carry-ons saves you time and aggravation checking your bags, plus you don't have to worry about losing your baggage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Get on a roll:</span> You can save space by rolling clothes instead of folding them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Watch your back (pack):</span> Pack heavier items in the bottom of your backpack and distribute items evenly from left to right. Use both straps to carry it, too.

                <ul class="list--numbered list--no-indent list--with-spacing">
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Have patience:</span> Try to relax and make the travel a fun part of your trip. Take the long ride as an opportunity to spend quality time with your little ones. Give them lots of attention, play games, tell them stories and by the time you're ready to come home they'll be talking about the "best trip ever!"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Capture the memories:</span> Buy each child an inexpensive disposable camera so they can take pictures. Your kids will really feel special when they can snap their own photos. They'll also love the resulting photos they can later use in a memory book of the trip.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Bag-O-Fun:</span> Prepare individual bags filled goodies, but don't let your kids look inside until you're on the road. They'll enjoy having their own personal items and will gladly spend hours with their snacks, games and crafts. Here's a quick list of items you can include in the bag, but get creative and consider each child's personality and hobbies. <br>
                    Favorite snacks, Books, Pad of paper, Coloring supplies, Pipe cleaners, Stickers, Games, Deck of cards, Puzzles, Brochures about your destination
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Don't forget to play:</span> Take the time to plan fun and creative games that can be played while you are traveling. Your children will have a blast and the time will fly by.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Vacation scrapbook:</span> Buy an inexpensive journal or notebook and encourage the kids to create a vacation scrapbook. Show them how to attach photos, tickets stubs, brochures, etc. from the places they visit. By the time the trip is over they'll have a great book of memories to go with the ones they'll always remember.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Never enough snacks:</span> Snacks are a good way to get children through times when they need to sit still or just aren't behaving (boarding a plane, for example). Snacks also help break up the monotony of a long road trip. The trick here is to be sure you don't give them out too fast. Pack snacks that are convenient and interesting to your children. Gummi Bears or fruit snacks top the list of quick and handy snacks for small children. For road trips, pack pretzels, potato chips or fruit. For younger children bring along sippy cups and don't forget wipes, napkins and small trash bags.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Games and crafts:</span> If you plan properly, you can add a number of games and crafts that will be interesting to your children. Bring a small serving tray or box with low sides. Your child can use this as his or her own personal workspace to make simple crafts such as pictures, puzzles or even Play-Doh. An excellent game for young children is MagnaDoodle. It's simple magnet drawings can be easily erased and small children have no problem scrawling pictures on it. You can even take turns drawing interesting little pictures with your child and each trying to guess what the other one is drawing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Be the DJ:</span> One of the most common things to pass the time on trips is listening to music. Be sure to bring selections your children will enjoy. You can also bring along CDs with children's stories or other educational material that your child may be interested in, just to mix it up a bit.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Potty time:</span> It may sound obvious, but make sure you always have your children go to the bathroom before you leave--even if they tell you they don't have to. Also, when taking long road trips with younger children, have them wear pull-ups while riding in the car.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="body-subtitle">Dollar store bonanza:</span> Make sure you visit the dollar store before your trip. You'll be able to find a bunch of cheap toys, supplies and many things that are fun as you travel with kids. You can even make a grab bag and reward your children for their good behavior. Let them draw for a prize every 50 miles or so on long road trips. This will add variety to the trip and give them something new to do in the meantime.

                <h4 class="body-subtitle">Ten Tips to Save on Travel</h4>
                <ul class="list--numbered list--no-indent list--with-spacing">
                  <li>Make a travel budget and stick to it. Decide how much you want to spend overall and how much you want to spend for each component of your trip, such as airfare, hotel accommodations, entertainment, and meals. </li>
                  <li>Don't forget about those unexpected expenses. Set aside money in your travel budget to cover those costs you might not anticipate, like a perfect souvenir or a forgotten travel essential.</li>
                  <li>Pick a hotel with free extras. Choosing a hotel with many free amenities, such as Internet access, parking, and local calls, can save money.  Best Western hotels offer other freebies, like basic toiletries and continental breakfasts. </li>
                  <li>Book early and online. The earlier you book, the more you may be able to save. Going online to book your trip also lets you take advantage of Internet only travel deals.</li>
                  <li>Go far from the crowd. Traveling off-peak, whether it means flying during a slower time of day or day of the week, or visiting a destination during a less popular time of year, means saving money and hassle.</li>
                  <li>Go farther from the crowd. Less well-known destinations or attractions offer you the same experiences as the "big names" for less money. Also, flying to a smaller city close to your destination can save you money and time.</li>
                  <li>Take advantage of discounts. If you belong to AAA or AARP, you can get discounts, freebies, and other deals on just about everything related to travel. Also, check into special deals for students, seniors, and families. Check out our <a href="SpecialOffers.html" title="Save on travel with Best Western's hotel discount programs">Hotel Discounts</a> to find out what discounts you may be eligible for.</li>
                  <li>Ask hotel staff about special deals. The staff and management at your hotel often has the inside track on economical attractions and activities in your destination, where to find cheap eats, and other deals you may not otherwise know about.</li>
                  <li>Take advantage of rewards programs. If you travel on a regular basis, consider signing up for rewards programs, such as credit cards, that offer you frequent flier miles or other reward points. Our <a href="RewardsLandingPage.html" title="Join Best Western's Rewards Program to save on travel">Rewards Program</a> lets you save on hotel stays, flights, restaurant meals, shopping, and entertainment.</li>
                  <li>Look into a package deal. Booking your hotel, flight, and rental car as a package saves you time and money. Best Western offers several discount hotel and travel packages to help you save money on your next trip. </li>
